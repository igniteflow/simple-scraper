python program that
- reads from a mongodb collection lists of urls in the form
"http://site.com/page"
example: {"urls": ["a","b","c"]}
- downloads the page
- extracts html page title (you can use scrappy, beautiful soup or
simple regex match)
- write list of titles corresponding to list of urls back to the mongodb
collection
example: {"urls": ["a","b","c"], "titles": [1,2,3]}

class Scrape

	def getUrls():
		return {"urls": ["a","b","c"]}
		
	def getResources(urls):
		
	def getTitle(page):
		return hxs.select('/html/head/title/text()').extract()
		
	def save():
		return {"urls": ["a","b","c"], "titles": [1,2,3]}
